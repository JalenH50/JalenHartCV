I work in a team setting where I am responsible for providing detailed work that includes both writing orders and designing kitchen layouts for guests. When creating an order for a guest, I use a DOS system, system V, that requires accurate numbers for product and ensures that guests are sold the correct item. When designing kitchens, I utilize a few different native programs. An example of their native programs includes 2020 Design©, which is a computer-aided design program, as well as their internal program, Ucreate©. I am also responsibile for keeping my department clean. Outside of my job requirements, I also use my spare time to assist other departments and assist in improving the work environment for others.</p>
